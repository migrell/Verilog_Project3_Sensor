2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U_fnd_controller/U_counter_8/r_counter_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U_fnd_controller/U_counter_8/r_counter_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.508 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.510 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.598 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.615 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.655 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.657 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#7 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.754 ns between U_dp/distance_counter_reg[3]_replica_2/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and U_dp/msec_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
