TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U_FND_CTRL/U_counter_8/r_counter_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U_FND_CTRL/U_counter_8/r_counter_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) dht_data direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (dht_data) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U_UART_FIFO_TOP/U_UART_CU/FSM_sequential_state[1]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U_UART_FIFO_TOP/U_UART_CU/btn_hour_reg/CLR,
